This is my really REALLY rough attempt at creating a Google Chrome Extension using React with Typescript. The idea of this extension is to record any text copy (ctrl + c) and save it into the database for later use. It saves the text, datetime of the copy, and the url that text came from.

It uses Firebase for authentication and DB access

There is a background script that handles all of the heavy lifting and a popup GUI. 

Firebase info has been redacted, and you would need to sign up for your own account to be provided with credientals
